## NewhomesTechTest - Technical Test for review by Josh Griffiths

Hi There!

I hope the code provided meets your standards for a developmental structure and code legibility. This  task took me around 3.5 Hours as I spent the first hour or so wrestling with my local machine just to get a base, unedited template to run.

If you so wish to, and for my sake of proof that AI was not used, you can find the Pull Request with all of my working commits in a personal work branch [Located HERE:](https://github.com/LukeKitKat/NewhomesTechTest/pull/1)

Listed below will be what is utilised within the project to complete the required specifications:

* .NET8
* Blazor Web Application Framework
* Dependency Injection
* Entity Framework Core

If there are any issues with running this application, please don't hesistate to let me know. I have made sure the program does actually run, however Blazor Web Apps can be a little fiddley to run when developing so there may be issues there.

**PLEASE RUN THE APPLICATION ON CHROME IF POSSIBLE. THIS IS THE BROWSER I WORKED WITH AND IS ONE I CAN GUARANTEE SHOULD WORK.**
